    \ excess of the length permitted under \xA7 156.052(D) materially affects public\

    \ dwelling unit shall be supplied with an approved garbage disposal facility,\
    \ which shall be any adequate mechanical food waste grinder in each dwelling unit\

    \ the owner may specify that this shall be the responsibility of the occupant\
    \ if sufficient space and adequate connections are provided.\r\n         (b) \
    \  A refrigerator or similar device capable of the safe storage of food at temperatures\
    \ less than 50\xBA F. but more than 3\xBA F. under ordinary maximum summer conditions,\
    \ properly installed with all necessary connections for safe, sanitary and efficient\
    \ operation, and in proper working condition, to be supplied by the owner; provided,\
    \ however, the owner may specify that this shall be the responsibility of the\
    \ occupant if sufficient space and adequate connections are provided.\r\n    \
    \     (c) Cabinets or shelves of sound construction and easily cleanable, to be\
    \ furnished by the owner, for the storage of eating, drinking, and cooking equipment\
