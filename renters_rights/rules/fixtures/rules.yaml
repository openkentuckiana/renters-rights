    legal_description: "(A)   General. The provisions of this subchapter shall govern
      the responsibilities of persons for the maintenance of structures, and the equipment
      and premises thereof. Every owner and occupant must fully comply with all the
      provisions of the Uniform Landlord Tenant Act/Ordinance. The occupant shall
      promptly notify the owner of any deficiencies and violations of this chapter.
      \ All premises shall be kept and maintained free of any public nuisance.\r\n\r\n(B)
      \  Sanitary condition.\r\n      (1)   Cleanliness.  Every occupant of a structure

      free of all weeds and prohibited plant growth, as defined in § 156.052(D), to
      the center line of such street, easement or alley as are adjacent to or abut

      Metro Government hereby declares that plant growth in excess of the length permitted
      under § 156.052(D) materially affects public health and safety and creates an
      emergency condition which allows a landlord to enter immediately upon the premises
      of a tenant as provided by § 151.33(B) solely to remedy such condition.  Every
      owner of a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units shall maintain, in
      a clean, safe and sanitary condition, and free of all weeds and prohibited plant
      growth, as defined in § 156.052(D), the shared or public areas of the dwelling
      and premises thereof to the center line of such street, easement or alley as
      are adjacent to or abut the premises. Any plant growth exceeding ten inches
      in height on land of three acres or more that abuts residential property, other

      approved containers, as required by § 156.055.\r\n      (3)   Disposal of garbage.
      Every occupant of a structure or part thereof shall dispose of garbage in a
      clean and sanitary manner by placing it in garbage disposal facilities, or if
      such facilities are not available, by securely wrapping such garbage and placing
      it in leak-proof approved containers, as required by § 156.055.\r\n      (4)
      \  Garbage storage facilities. Every dwelling unit shall be supplied with an
      approved garbage disposal facility, which shall be any adequate mechanical food
      waste grinder in each dwelling unit or leak-proof approved containers, as required
      by § 156.055(E).  Such facilities shall be sufficient to meet the needs of the
      occupants.\r\n      (5)   Rubbish storage facilities. Every dwelling unit shall
      be supplied with leak-proof approved containers as required by § 156.055(E)
      for storage of rubbish, and the occupant shall be responsible for the removal
      of such rubbish.\r\n      (6)   Food preparation. All spaces used or intended
      to be used for food preparation shall contain suitable space and approved equipment
      to store, prepare and serve food in a sanitary manner. There shall be adequate
      facilities and services for the sanitary disposal of food wastes and refuse,

      to be supplied by the owner; provided, however, the owner may specify that this
      shall be the responsibility of the occupant if sufficient space and adequate
      connections are provided.\r\n         (b)   A refrigerator or similar device
      capable of the safe storage of food at temperatures less than 50º F. but more
      than 3º F. under ordinary maximum summer conditions, properly installed with
      all necessary connections for safe, sanitary and efficient operation, and in
      proper working condition, to be supplied by the owner; provided, however, the
      owner may specify that this shall be the responsibility of the occupant if sufficient
      space and adequate connections are provided.\r\n         (c) Cabinets or shelves
      of sound construction and easily cleanable, to be furnished by the owner, for
      the storage of eating, drinking, and cooking equipment and utensils, and of
      food that does not under ordinary summer conditions require refrigeration for
      safe keeping, to be supplied by the owner.\r\n      (7)   Supplied fixtures
      and equipment. The owner or occupant of a structure or part thereof shall keep

      dwelling units, smoke detectors powered by a hard wire AC primary power source
      or a self-monitored, non-removal ten-year lithium battery shall be installed
      and maintained after the effective date of this section. Single station detectors
      presently installed utilizing standard batteries may continue to be used as
      long as the units remain operational.  Should an inspection of the concerned
      properties reveal these units out of service due to a low or no battery, it
      will be cause to replace the units with at least smoke detectors powered by
      a hard wire AC primary power source or a self-monitored, non-removal ten-year
      lithium battery.\r\n      (2)   In order to comply with this section, only ionization
      or photoelectric type detectors listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory
      shall be installed.\r\n      (3)   Smoke detectors shall be installed in accordance

      in the corridor within the unit or interior area giving access to the rooms
      used for sleeping purposes. Where sleeping areas are separated and/or where
      a single smoke detector will not adequately service all sleeping areas, there
      shall be a smoke detector installed adjacent to each sleeping area. In a rooming
      unit the detector shall be centrally located.\r\n      (5)   In a dwelling containing
      two or more dwelling units or any rooming unit, in addition to the requirements
      for individual smoke detectors in each dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors
      shall be placed in centrally located common areas so that smoke detectors will
      adequately service all sleeping areas.\r\n   (C)   Installation and maintenance.\r\n
      \     (1)   The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and installing
      in an operable condition, the required detectors and for providing the manufacturer's
      maintenance and testing instructions to the tenant.\r\n      (2)   The owner

      in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which are located in common
      areas and/or detectors in rooming units where the tenant usually has periods
      of occupancy, (less than 30 continuous days, such as, hotels, motels, tourist
      homes).\r\n      (3)   The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing
      the detectors, in accordance with the manufacturer' instructions, which are
      within his or her exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant
      shall be responsible for notifying the owner in writing when detectors become
      inoperable, and the owner shall have ten days after receipt of such written
      notice in which to replace or repair the detectors in an operable condition.
      In the existing single station, battery-operated types of detectors, battery
      replacement will not be allowed. In the event existing detectors with standard
      batteries are found inoperable, the units shall be replaced with at least smoke
      detectors powered by a hardwire AC primary power source or a self-monitored,
      non-removal ten-year lithium battery.\r\n      (4)   At every change of tenancy
      in all multi-family residential units and dormitories, it shall be the duty
      of the owner to test and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit
      are in operable condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing
      them in operable condition.  Further, in the event existing detectors with standard
      batteries are found inoperable, the owner shall be responsible for replacing
      such detectors with at least smoke detectors powered by a hardwire AC primary
      power source or a self-monitored, non-removal ten-year lithium battery.       \r\n
      \     (5)   In all hotels, motels, rooming houses or tourist homes it shall
      be the duty of the owner to test such detectors on a regular basis in accordance

      such units in an operable condition. A log of smoke detector inspections and
      findings shall be maintained by the owner, and shall be made available to fire
      inspectors upon request.\r\n      (6)   It shall be the responsibility of the
      property owner to install at least smoke detectors powered by a hardwire AC
      primary power source or a self-monitored, non-removal ten year lithium battery
      before transfer of the property to a new party.  A signed affidavit of the property
      owner, given to purchaser, seller, and real estate agent before transfer will
      suffice in meeting this requirement.\r\n      (7)   Where AC powered detectors
      have been installed and maintained in accordance with previous ordinances, they
      shall continue to be used in accordance with the manufacturers installation
      and maintenance guidelines.  Such smoke detectors that are found to be non-operational,
      damaged, or missing shall be replaced with a hard wire AC powered smoke detector
      of similar or like-type.\r\n   (D)   Enforcement.\r\n      (1)   The Chief of
      the Fire Department, Fire District, or Code Official or any of their designated

      be the sole discretion of the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), as described
      in 815 KAR 10:060, of the Fire Department, or the Fire District, or Code Official.
      \ Upon the presentation of official credentials, an authorized inspector of
      the Fire Department, Fire District or Code Official, may enter with consent
      any premises covered by these regulations to perform the duties imposed upon
      him or her by these regulations. \r\n      (2)   The source of authority to

      inoperable, and the owner shall have ten days after receipt of such written
      notice in which to replace or repair the detectors in an operable condition.
      In the existing single station, battery-operated types of detectors, battery
      replacement will not be allowed. In the event existing detectors with standard
      batteries are found inoperable, the units shall be replaced with at least smoke
      detectors powered by a hardwire AC primary power source or a self-monitored,
      non-removal ten-year lithium battery.\r\n      (4)   At every change of tenancy
      in all multi-family residential units and dormitories, it shall be the duty
      of the owner to test and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit
      are in operable condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing
      them in operable condition.  Further, in the event existing detectors with standard
      batteries are found inoperable, the owner shall be responsible for replacing
      such detectors with at least smoke detectors powered by a hardwire AC primary
      power source or a self-monitored, non-removal ten-year lithium battery.       \r\n
      \     (5)   In all hotels, motels, rooming houses or tourist homes it shall
      be the duty of the owner to test such detectors on a regular basis in accordance
      with manufacturer's instructions, and the owner shall be responsible for maintaining
      such units in an operable condition. A log of smoke detector inspections and
      findings shall be maintained by the owner, and shall be made available to fire
      inspectors upon request.\r\n      (6)   It shall be the responsibility of the
      property owner to install at least smoke detectors powered by a hardwire AC
      primary power source or a self-monitored, non-removal ten year lithium battery
      before transfer of the property to a new party.  A signed affidavit of the property
      owner, given to purchaser, seller, and real estate agent before transfer will
      suffice in meeting this requirement.\r\n      (7)   Where AC powered detectors
      have been installed and maintained in accordance with previous ordinances, they
      shall continue to be used in accordance with the manufacturers installation
      and maintenance guidelines.  Such smoke detectors that are found to be non-operational,
      damaged, or missing shall be replaced with a hard wire AC powered smoke detector
      of similar or like-type.\r\n   (D)   Enforcement.\r\n      (1)   The Chief of
      the Fire Department, Fire District, or Code Official or any of their designated
      representatives, are hereby authorized and directed to enforce all provisions
      of this section and the final determination concerning compliance herewith shall
